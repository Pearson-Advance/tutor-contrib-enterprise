# Contributing to this plugin.

Contributions to this Tutor plugin are very welcome,
and strongly encouraged! Here's a step-by-step guide
that should help you get started.

### Step 0: Join the conversation

Got an idea for how to improve the codebase? Fantastic, we'd love to hear about
it! Before you dive in and spend a lot of time and effort making a pull request,
it's a good idea to discuss your idea with other interested developers, maintainers and/or the
Pearson-Edunext team. You may get some valuable feedback that changes how you think
about your idea, or you may find other developers who have the same idea and want
to work together.

### Step 1: Branch, Commit and Pull Request

- As a suggestion, create a branch as follows: <developer_name/feature_name>
- Make any changes and improvements you deem necessary.
- Make sure to commit according to the standards of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Create a PR containing your changes.
- Add entries to the CHANGELOG.md file as required.
- The branch must be up to date with respect to 'main'. Use [rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/es/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) for this.
- The PR must have an update to the file [CHANGELOG.rst](https://github.com/Pearson-Advance/tutor-contrib-enterprise/CHANGELOG.md). All changes must be specified as 'unreleased'.
- Once the PR is approved, we perform squash and merge.

### Step 2: Create a release

1. In development, we position ourselves in the main branch and update it.
2. We use [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/) to create commit and tag releases:
    `bumpversion [major, minor, patch]`
3. Changes marked as 'unreleased' become 'released', they are identified with the date and the version that has generated `bumpversion`.
4. The commit generated by `bumpversion`, which must also include the recent changes in CHANGELOG.md is pushed.
5. The tag generated by bumpversion is also pushed:
    `git push origin <generated_bumpversion_tag>`
6. Finnaly, create a github `release`(https://docs.github.com/es/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
